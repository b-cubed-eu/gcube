\title{Apply manual sampling bias to occurrences via a grid}
\usage{
apply_manual_sampling_bias(occurrences_sf, bias_weights)
}
\arguments{
\item{occurrences_sf}{An sf object with POINT geometry representing the
occurrences.}

\item{bias_weights}{An \code{sf} object with POLYGON geometry representing the
grid with bias weights. This sf object should contain a \code{bias_weight} column
and a \code{geometry} column. Higher weights indicate a higher probability of
sampling. Weights must be numeric values between 0 and 1 or positive
integers, which will be rescaled to values between 0 and 1.}
}
\value{
An sf object with POINT geometry that includes a \code{bias_weight}
column containing the sampling probabilities based on the sampling bias.
}
\description{
This function adds a sampling bias weight column to an sf object containing
occurrences. The sampling probabilities are based on bias weights within each
cell of a provided grid layer.
