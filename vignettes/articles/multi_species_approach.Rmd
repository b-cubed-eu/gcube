The workflow for simulating a biodiversity data cubes is provided in tutorials 1-3.
However, this workflow only describes a data cube for a single species.
As such, it is not really a cube since it is not three-dimensional.
Furthermore, many biodiversity indicators are calculated over multiple species.

This tutorial describes the functions provided to simulate biodiversity data cubes for multiple species directly.

```{r setup, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# Load packages
library(gcube)

library(sf)        # work with spatial objects
library(dplyr)     # data wrangling
library(ggplot2)   # data visualisation
```
