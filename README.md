The goal of **simcuber** is to provide a simulation framework for
biodiversity data cubes using the R programming language. This can start
from simulating multiple species distributed in a landscape over a
temporal scope. In a second phase, the simulation of a variety of
observation processes and effort can generate actual occurrence
datasets. Based on their (simulated) spatial uncertainty, occurrences
can then be designated to a grid to form a data cube.

Simulation studies offer numerous benefits due to their ability to mimic
real-world scenarios in controlled and customizable environments.
Ecosystems and biodiversity data are very complex and involve a
multitude of interacting factors. Simulations allow researchers to model
and understand the complexity of ecological systems by varying
parameters such as spatial and/or temporal clustering, species
prevalence, etc.

## Installation

You can install the development version from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("b-cubed-eu/simcuber")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

``` r
library(simcuber)
```
