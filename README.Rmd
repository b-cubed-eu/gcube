# simcuber

The goal of **simcuber** is to provide a simulation framework for biodiversity data cubes using the R programming language. This can start from simulating multiple species distributed in a landscape over a temporal scope. In a second phase, the simulation of a variety of observation processes and effort can generate actual occurrence datasets. Based on their (simulated) spatial uncertainty, occurrences can then be designated to a grid to form a data cube.

Simulation studies offer numerous benefits due to their ability to mimic real-world scenarios in controlled and customizable environments. Ecosystems and biodiversity data are very complex and involve a multitude of interacting factors. Simulations allow researchers to model and understand the complexity of ecological systems by varying parameters such as spatial and/or temporal clustering, species prevalence, etc.

## Installation

You can install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("b-cubed-eu/simcuber")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
#library(simcuber)
```

...
