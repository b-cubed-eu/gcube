  abstract = "This R package provides a simulation framework for biodiversity data cubes. This can start from simulating multiple species distributed in a landscape over a temporal scope. In a second phase, the simulation of a variety of observation processes and effort can generate actual occurrence datasets. Based on their (simulated) spatial uncertainty, occurrences can then be designated to a grid to form a data cube.",
