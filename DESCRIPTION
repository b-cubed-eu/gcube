Description: simcuber provide a simulation framework for
    biodiversity data cubes using the R programming language. This can
    start from simulating multiple species distributed in a landscape over
    a temporal scope. In a second phase, the simulation of a variety of
    observation processes and effort can generate actual occurrence
    datasets. Based on their (simulated) spatial uncertainty, occurrences
    can then be designated to a grid to form a data cube. Simulation
    studies offer numerous benefits due to their ability to mimic
    real-world scenarios in controlled and customizable environments. The
    simulation framework can be used to assess multiple research questions
    under different parameter settings, such as the effect of clustering
    on occurrence-to-grid designation and the effect of different patterns
    of missingness on data quality and indicator robustness.
